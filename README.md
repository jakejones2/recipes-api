Just figuring out basic APIs with ASP.NET Core!

### To do

- Add integration tests
- Create endpoint that returns recipes that can be cooked with current stock
- Create seed function
- Deploy on Azure
- Create GraphQL api
- Create more unit tests
- Rename RecipesController plural, rename RecipeIngredients vs RecipeIngredient
- General refactoring
- Move some db logic into repository classes?
